<h2><b>EDGE 64</b> is a Doom 2 modification megawad for the EDGE source port. It is a project in the style of Doom 64, however it is not created as a total conversion of Doom 64.</h2>

<em>_**For more faithful renditions of Doom 64, please check out Doom 64: Absolution for the Doomsday Engine, Doom 64: Retribution for GZDOOM, and Brutal Doom 64 for the GZDOOM engine.**_ </em>

`This project will come packaged with user-created levels tuned to challenge any demon slayer. Consider supporting the official release by Bethesda through Steam, or Microsoft Store.` **IN ORDER TO RUN EDGE64 YOU MUST HAVE A DOOM2.WAD** game, `or you can use FREEDOOM2 which is a freeware open-source project to make playing patched and user-created content possible. You can download the project` <a href="https://freedoom.github.io/download.html">here</a>. 

<h3><em>EDGE 64 is designed to run on Windows, Linux, BSD, Macintosh, Raspberry Pi & Xbox Developer Mode. It will not run with other source ports.</em></h3>

>- _Special Effects for fireballs, explosions, environments, and enemies_
>- _Breakable glass, portals, & sliding doors_
>- _Several new maps custom-created ranging in small, medium and somewhat large levels_
>- _New "Skirmish" game mode_
>- _Boss encounters and secrets galore_
>- _Weapon upgrades for each slot, such as increased firing rates, grenade launchers, and more!_
>- _Pyro Demon, a Cacodemon variant that resurrects the dead, and shoots fire that can trap you!_
>- _Plasma Commando, a Chaingunner variant that shoots plasma rifle energy at you! Take him out quickly._
>- _Wolf Soldiers, soldiers in black armed with UAC firepower. Stop these guys before they get you!_
>- _Collect green skull drops & trade them for gear, protection & get firepower that feeds on demon's souls._
>- _Lore is waiting to be uncovered! Scattered throughout the levels, search your fallen comrades for the scoop of this story beat._

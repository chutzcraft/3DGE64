**3DGE 64** is a _Doom 2 modification for the EDGE source port._ It is a project in the style of Doom 64, however it is not created as a total conversion of Doom 64. _**For more "faithful" renditions of Doom 64, please check out Doom 64: Absolution for the Doomsday Engine, Doom 64: Retribution for GZDOOM, and Brutal Doom 64 for the GZDOOM engine.**_ This project will come packaged with user-created levels tuned to challenge any demon slayer. 


## Features

**3DGE 64** also comes with port-specific features & charms of its own, such as: 

>- _Three-dimensional Geometry, such as bridges, platforms, slopes, room-over-room environments, and more_
>- _Special Effects for fireballs, explosions, environments, and enemies_
>- _Several new maps custom-created for 3DGE and the modification_
>- _New "Skirmish" game mode_
>- _Boss encounters and secrets galore_
>- _Weapon upgrades for each slot, such as increased firing rates, grenade launchers, and more!_
>- _Pyro Demon, a Cacodemon variant that resurrects the dead, and shoots fire that can trap you!_
>- _Plasma Commando, a Chaingunner variant that shoots plasma rifle energy at you! Take him out quickly._
>- _Wolf Soldiers, soldiers in black armed with UAC firepower. Stop these guys before they get you!_
>- _Collect green skull drops & trade them for gear, protection & get firepower that feeds on demon's souls._
>- _Lore is waiting to be uncovered! Scattered throughout the levels, seaarch your fallen comrades for the scoop of this story beat._

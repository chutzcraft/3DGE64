Welcome to the 3DGE 64 Documentation. This context contains general information regarding the engine,
the mod, and objects in the game world. As time goes on, this file will continue to be updated.

### About this Mod ###
3DGE 64 began in 2015 and was created for 3DGE version 1.36 Final.
A single-level [demo](http://www.wadsinprogress.info/index.php?a=listwads&wad=1771) was released
early that following year in March. During 2015-2016, the demo received more work behind scenes such as more
levels though eventually scrapped along with several sprites and assets reducted to simple replacements.
Brand new levels were created in place of older ones including geometry tweaks to the 2015 demonstration map.

## F.A.Q. ## 

**Do you fight the Motherdemon?** _This cannot be said for sure. The communications tower near the monster's nest went down._

**What makes 3DGE 64 different than any other Doom 64 mod out there?** _This mod comes with its own universe and renditions
in style of Doom 64. The maps are all created from scratch, and have the feel of a Doom 64 expansion. The mod also gives
players of EDGE community fun variety of flavor for them to try at their leisure. A note to a nice community of developers :)
While you won't find corners wrecked with gore, or familiar layouts you can dash through - you can expect to at best enjoy 
this expansion alone or with a friend in splitscreen mode!_ 

**Which Sourceport should I use to play EDGE64?** EDGE64 works with both the latest 2018 EDGE2 repository fork found here https://sourceforge.net/projects/edge2/files/latest/download. You can also use EDGE Classic, a Legacy version of the original EDGE,
which is suited to work best with low-end processors. This could help run other mods very well on your computer. Run these by your
specifications for a favorable experience.

**How to upgrade weapons?**
_In order to upgrade your weapons, you must previously own an existing version of the original. Survivability is key to maximizing the efficiency of your weapons. You can find the upgraded versions dropped on initial weapons placed throughout the map, or an enemy of that respective upgrade will drop it for you._

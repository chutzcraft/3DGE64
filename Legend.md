# LEGEND
`On Deimos, you're going to need more than the desire to survive in order to best this nightmare.`

`This legend should help provide some intel on the enemies, weapons, items and strange phenomenon you will occur while out in the field.`

`Though this legend may be obscure, and a bit vague, it was procured by our best scouts in the ground squad.`

`When you're lucky to make it back alive, you give what you can. Study up, study hard.  - Major`

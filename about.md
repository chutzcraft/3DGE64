Welcome to the EDGE 64 Documentation. This context contains general information regarding the engine,
the mod, and objects in the game world. As time goes on, this file will continue to be updated. (10/10/2023)

### About this Mod ###
`EDGE 64 began in 2015 and previously for 3DGE version 1.36 Final. It has since found consistent support
and updates on the EDGE Classic sourceport engine.`
A single-level [demo](http://www.wadsinprogress.info/index.php?a=listwads&wad=1771) was released
early that following year in March. During 2015-2016, the demo received more work behind scenes such as more
levels, eventually being fleshed out into a full-fledged total conversion!
`Brand new levels were created in place of older ones including geometry tweaks to the 2015 demonstration map.`

**Do you fight the Motherdemon?**

>_This cannot be said for sure. The communications tower near the monster's nest went down._

**What makes 3DGE 64 different than any other Doom 64 mod out there?**

>_This mod comes with its own universe and renditions in style of Doom 64._ 

<p>The maps are all created from scratch, and have the feel of a Doom 64 expansion. The mod also gives
players of EDGE community fun variety of flavor for them to try at their leisure. A note to a nice community of developers :)
EDGE64 uses different selections of weapons, and includes an abridged storyline to set it apart from its contemporaries.</p>

>_In fact, some ideas from EDGE64 have inspired Brutal Doom 64, such as Lost Souls leaving fire trails._ 

**Which Sourceport should I use to play EDGE64?** 

><p>_EDGE64 works with EDGE Classic, an enhanced & improved version of the original EDGE,_
>hich is suited to work best with low-end processors. This could help run other mods very well on your computer. Run these by your
>_specifications for a favorable experience._</p>

**How to upgrade weapons?**

<p>_Weapon-forging is a new ordinance mechanic introduced to EDGE64. Originally, you would need to have newer weapons dropped by owning_
_a previous version of it. Now, through the Reaper the payer can trade a rare item drop - Green Skull - for weapons and armor._</p>

**How to upgrade the Unmaker?**

><p>_Once you acquire the Unmaker, you'll need to find the artifacts which are hidden in secret levels. Each secret level has it's own_
>_predisposed conditions on how to acquire the artifact. Complete them, and you'll be able to fuse the artifacts with the weapon._</p>

**What is the difference between Purple, Yellow & Red Armor?**

><p>_The new armor system are exclusive to EDGE only. Existing since EDGE's early days, these additional tiers of armor are hard-coded_
>_to diversify the defensive capabilites of receiving damage. This gives us new ways to absorb damage as well. Base EDGE armor_
>_percentages work like this:_</p>

_Worn by EOD operatives during their base missions on Mars & its moons,_ <font color="purple">Major(Purple)</font> & <font color="yellow">Super(Yellow)</font> _armors are particularly effective_
_for blast-absorption and repelling debris. It takes a little bit longer to bang them up, as it would be said._ <font color="red">Red Armor</font> **is supernatural,**
_and seems to be an amalgamation of beast-like flesh and Lonsdaliete._

**What's the story?**

`Fallen marines throughout levels can spawn lore entries which share bits and pieces of the events on Deimos leading up to our Marine's
return to the installation. After leaving Phobos, he returns back to Deimos to investigate the incident. Find these lore entries
to get a back story on the current conflict.`

**What is the Reaper?**

Inspired by DOOM 2016's multiplayer-only DLC weapon, the `Reaper` is a demonic weapon with an insectile appearance and powered by what
appears to be a Lost Soul. Instead of firing in burtsts, this version unleashes `Reaper Souls` that lock-on to targets, pierces through
flesh & metal, and causes explosion-damage within an impact radius. It also has the magical properties to absorb life force, and `heal`
the user. Upon using it in close quarters,it may damage anything in its range, including its user, so space must be accounted for when 
wielding it. The Reaper has a class definition of Magick (CLASS_ATTACK=N for Necro) meaning all but few monsters are resistant to its
power. Much thanks and credits are given to `Noiser, DrPySpy, Neccronixis & Franco Tieppo` for their work in Doom 4 Vanilla.
